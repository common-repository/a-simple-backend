A Simple Backend allows designers or anyone to create an ultra minimalist WordPress CMS admin without any limitations!

== Description ==
A Simple Backend can bring order to a chaotic WordPress admin by putting a minimalist interface in place whilst always keeping the full power of WordPress within easy reach.

A Simple Backend will make several enhancements to the WordPress CMS such as a minimalist interface throughout, subtle responsive design changes for improved mobile use and much more. This isn't your ordinary admin cleanup plugin. A Simple Backend was built with the deliverables of designers in mind but from the usage perspective of the client.

It is this simple. Build your website, install the plugin and then build A Simple Backend by activating and editing the simple menu. Now your user has an easy to use administration section but advanced features are always within reach via the WordPress (W) button contained within the "A Simple Backend" menu.

== Installation ==
1. Upload `the directory "a-simple-backend"` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Proceed to the settings via the notice at the top
4. Start customizing your options and building your simple menu.
5. Just login in the future and the plugin automatically sends you to simple mode.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Is this plugin compatible with WordPress Multi Site? =

Yes.

= Does this plugin change the post/page editor for third party plugins? =

No it doesn't change the post/page editor for plugins such as WooCommerce and others.

= Do you offer a "Pro" version of this plugin? =

Nope and we have no intentions thus far of releasing a professional version.
